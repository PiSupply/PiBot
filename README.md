# Notes
Camera panel has purpose to adopt camera mechanics to pan-tilt mechanics with appropriate shape and screw holes. No LED driver on this board, driver is on main board and provided on connector P4, same signals intended for servo drive also. There is mosfets on this boards that amplifies LED currents, and can be configured with additional resistor to drive high brightness smd white LEDs, for example 2 x 250 mA. Through hole LEDs are limited to 20 mA only.
